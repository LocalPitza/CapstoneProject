  description: Turnips are root vegetables with a round shape and smooth, pale skin,
    typically white with a hint of purple near the top where the leaves sprout. They
    have a crisp texture and a slightly sweet, peppery flavor when raw, becoming
    milder and sweeter when cooked. Both the root and leafy greens are edible, making
    turnips a versatile vegetable.
